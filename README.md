# SpectrumAnalyzer
To analyze the spectrum of an image.
This script loads an image file called image.jpg and displays the magnitude of its Fourier transform. You can modify the script to analyze the spectrum of different images by changing the file name in the Image.open function.

The magnitude of the Fourier transform represents the frequency content of the image. Higher frequencies correspond to smaller, more detailed features in the image, while lower frequencies correspond to larger, more diffuse features. By analyzing the spectrum of an image, you can learn more about the dominant frequencies and patterns in the image.
